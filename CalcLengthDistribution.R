# "rates" is a vector of probabilities of the relationship between a husband and a wife (a mating pair).

# Also note that these events are mutually exclusive
# So, with probability 1-sum(rates), the spouses are unrelated in the
# past length(rates) generations.

# to the kinship coefficient defined above for the time period 1-max_T_exact_model generations.
